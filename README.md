A React project that simulates a Pokedex like app. \
This project is an ongoing project, during FiiPractic courses, more exactly as weekly homeworks, each week having more features to be added. \
The main page initially contains a list of 21 pokemon card. At the end of the 21 pokemon there is a button that loads the next 21 pokemon. \
Each card contains the name of the pokemon, a picture of it, but also the categories to which it belongs. Each card has a hoover zoom animation. \
The main page also contains a Search Bar, so you can search for a pokemon by name. \
\
\
When you click on a card, it redirects you to the page of each pokemon. \
This page contains a main card, in which the details about the pokemon are presented, such as height, weight, habitat. \
The user can also select from which game he wants to view the description of the pokemon. \
There is also a container for pokemon evolutions. They can evolve into 1 or more pokemon. \
On each page there is a next and previous button, so you can more easily access the pokemons. \
The site is also responsive.
